Chang chang changity chang shoo bop that's the way it should be

Our names are signed like boogy boogy boogy boogy shooby shoo wap shoo wap  
Chang chang changity chang shoo bop we'll always be like one  
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-one  
  
When we go out a night (oh oh)  
And stars are shining bright (oh, oh)  
Up in the skies above  
Or at the high school dance  
Where you can find romance maybe it might be oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh
