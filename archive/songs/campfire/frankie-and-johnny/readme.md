===
  
Frankie and Johnny were lovers  
Lordy oh how they did love  
Swore to be true to each other  
True as the stars above  
He was her man he wouldn't do her wrong  
  
Frankie went down to the barroom  
Just for to get her some beer  
Said to the fat bartender  
has my lover Johnny been here  
he is my man he wouldn't do me wrong  
  
I ain't gonna tell you no stories  
I ain't gonna tell you no lies  
I saw your Johnny half an hour ago  
Making love to Nellie Bly  
He is your man but he's doing you wrong  
  
Frankie went back to the hotel  
She didn't go for fun  
Frankie went back to get a hold of  
of Johnny's shooting gun  
He was her man but he was doing her wrong  
  
Frankie drew back her kimono  
pulled out her li'l 44  
rooty toot toot three times she shoot  
right through the hardwood door  
She shot her man cos he was doin' her wrong  
  
Roll me over easy  
Roll me over slow  
Honey don't roll me on my left side  
Cause the bullets hurt me so  
I was your man but I was doin' you wrong  
  
Roll out your rubber-tyred hearses  
Roll our your rubber-tyred hacks (?)  
Seven men goin' to the graveyard  
Six men coming back  
He was her man but he was doin' her wrong  
  
The sheriff arrested Frankie  
Threw her in jail the next day  
Locked her up in a prison cell  
And threw the key away  
For shootin' her man cos he was doin' her wrong  
  
This story ain't got no moral  
this story ain't got no end  
this story only goes to show  
that there ain't no good in men  
he was her man but he was doin' her wrong.
