# Mobi Data


## The app:[Mobi-Data]( http://mobi-data.github.io )


Useful information on the move is what we want to provide you.


For example, you are out in thw wilderness with good peeps.

What information do you need?

The lyrics to songs you can sing together is a nice-to-have.

Coming soon will be a 3D walkthrough of your hike or ride based on data from your phone or GPS device.

After that will we will try to bring back a feature of an earler revision of this app:

The location of the closest donut shop.
