<h1>Joy To The World!</h1>

Joy to the world! The Lord is come.<br />
Let earth receive her King<br />
Let every heart<br />
Prepare Him room<br />
And Saints and angels sing<br />
And Saints and angels sing<br />
And Saints and Saints and angels sing<br />
<br />
Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns<br />
Let Saints their songs employ<br />
While fields and floods<br />
rocks, hills and plains<br />
Repeat the sounding joy<br />
Repeat the sounding joy<br />
Repeat, Repeat, the sounding joy<br />
<br />
Joy to the world with truth and grace<br />
And makes the nations prove<br />
The glories of His righteousness<br />
And wonders of His love<br />
And wonders of His love<br />
And wonders and wonders of His love<br />
<br />
No more will sin and sorrow grow,<br />
Nor thorns infest the ground;<br />
He'll come and make the blessings flow<br />
Far as the curse was found,<br />
Far as the curse was found,<br />
Far as, far as the curse was found.<br />
<br />
He rules the world with truth and grace,<br />
And gives to nations proof<br />
The glories of His righteousness,<br />
And wonders of His love;<br />
And wonders of His love;<br />
And wonders, wonders of His love.<br />
<br />
Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,<br />
While Israel spreads abroad<br />
Like stars that glitter in the sky,<br />
And ever worship God,<br />
And ever worship God,<br />
And ever, and ever worship God.<br />
<br />
