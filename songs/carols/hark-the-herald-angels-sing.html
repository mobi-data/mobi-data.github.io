<h1>Hark! The Herald Angels Sing</h1>
Hark! the herald angels sing<br><br />
"Glory to the newborn King<br />
Peace on earth and mercy mild,<br />
God and sinners reconciled!"<br />
Joyful, all ye nations rise;<br />
Join the triumph of the skies;<br />
With angelic host proclaim<br />
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"<br /><br />
Hark! the herald angels sing<br />
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br />
Christ, by highest heaven adored;<br />
Christ the everlasting Lord;<br />
Late in time behold Him come,<br />
Offspring of the favored one.<br />
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;<br />
hail the incarnate Deity<br />
Pleased as man with men to dwell,<br />
Jesus, our Emmanuel<br /><br />
Hark! the herald angels sing,<br />
"Glory to the newborn King"<br />
Hail! the heaven-born Prince of Peace!<br />
Hail! the Son of Righteousness!<br />
Light and life to all He brings,<br />
risen with healing in His wings.<br />
Mild He lays His glory by,<br />
born that man no more may die;<br />
Born to raise the sons of earth,<br />
born to give them second birth<br />
<br />
Hark! the herald angels sing,<br />
"Glory to the newborn King"<br />
<br />
