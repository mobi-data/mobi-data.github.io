# The First Noël

The first Noël the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds –
in fields as they lay;
In fields as they lay, –
keeping their sheep,
on a cold winter's night –
that was so deep.
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east
beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued
both day and night.
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh
to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place
where Jesus lay.
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël,
Born is the King of Israel.
