<h1>It Came Upon the Midnight Clear</h1>
It came upon the midnight clear,<br />
That glorious song of old,<br />
From angels bending<br />
near the earth<br />
To touch their harps of gold:<br />
"Peace on the earth,<br />
good will to men,<br />
From heaven's all-gracious King."<br />
The world in solemn stillness lay<br />
To hear the angels sing.<br />
<br />
Still through the cloven skies<br />
they come<br />
With peaceful wings unfurled,<br />
And still their<br />
heavenly music floats<br />
O'er all the weary world;<br />
Above its sad and lowly plains<br />
They bend on hovering wing,<br />
And ever o'er its Babel-sounds<br />
The blessed angels sing.<br />
<br />
For lo! the days are hastening on,<br />
By prophets seen of old,<br />
When with the ever-circling years<br />
Shall come the time foretold,<br />
When peace shall over all the earth<br />
Its ancient splendors fling,<br />
And the whole world<br />
give back the song<br />
Which now the angels sing.<br />
