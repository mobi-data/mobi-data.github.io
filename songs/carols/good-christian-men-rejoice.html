<h1>Good Christian Men, Rejoice</h1>
Good Christian men, rejoice,<br />
With heart and soul, and voice;<br />
Give ye heed to what we say:<br />
Jesus Christ is born to-day; <br />
Ox and ass before him bow, <br />
And he is in the manger now. <br />
Christ is born to-day! <br />
Christ is born to-day! <br />
<br />
Good Christian men, rejoice, <br />
With heart and soul, and voice; <br />
Now ye hear of endless bliss: <br />
Jesus Christ was born for this! <br />
He hath opened the heavenly door<br />
And man is blessed evermore.<br />
Christ was born for this! <br />
Christ was born for this! <br />
<br />
Good Christian men, rejoice, <br />
With heart and soul, and voice;<br />
Now ye need not fear the grave:<br />
Jesus Christ was born to save!<br />
Calls you one and calls you all <br />
To gain his everlasting hall.<br />
Christ was born to save!<br />
Christ was born to save! <br />
