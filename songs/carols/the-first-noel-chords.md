# The First NoÃ«l

```
   G         D  
The first Noel 
    C            G
the angel did say 
       C
Was to certain poor 
D           C              G
Shepards in fields as they lay: 
   G                   D
In fields where they lay
  C             G 
a keeping their sheep
     C             D              C  G  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.


  G    D    C    G

C           D       C   G
Born is the King of Israel.
 

     G      D   
They looked up 
    C     G
and saw a star 
        C      D       C        G
Shining in the east beyond them far:
    G      D       
And to the earth 
   C          G
it gave great light
    C         D          C       G  
And so it continued both day and night.

C           D       C   G
Born is the King of Israel


    G         D  
And by the light
    C        G
of that same star 
      C        D             C       G
Three wise men came from the country far; 
   G          D
To seek for a King
    C       G 
was their intent, 
       C          D        C       G  
And to follow the star wherever it went. 


  G    D    C    G

C           D       C   G
Born is the King of Israel



     G    D  
This star drew 
     C            G
nigh to the north-west; 
     C     D      C         G
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest, 
    G        D
And there it did
     C        G 
both stop and stay, 
      C        D           C     G  
Right over the place where Jesus lay. 


  G    D    C    G

C           D       C   G
Born is the King of Israel



     G       D  
Then entered in
      C        G
those wise men three, 
     C          D          C   G
Fell reverently upon their knee, 
    G       D
And offered there 
       C  G 
in his presence 
      C        D         C      G  
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. 


  G    D    C    G
Noel Noel Noel Noel
C           D       C   G
Born is the King of Israel


     G      D  
Then let us all
     C   G
with one accord  
     C       D      C        G
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord, 
     G    D
That hath made
           C        G 
heaven and earth of nought,
    C        D     C           G  
And with his blood mankind has bought.

C           D       C   G
Born is the King of Israel
