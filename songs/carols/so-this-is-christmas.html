<h1>So This is Christmas</h1>
So this is Christmas<br />
And what have you done<br />
Another year over<br />
And a new one just begun<br />
And so this is Christmas<br />
I hope you have fun<br />
The near and the dear one<br />
The old and the young<br />
<br />
A very merry Christmas<br />
And a happy New Year<br />
Let's hope it's a good one<br />
Without any fear<br />
<br />
And so this is Christmas<br />
For weak and for strong<br />
For rich and the poor ones<br />
The world is so wrong<br />
And so happy Christmas<br />
For black and for white<br />
For yellow and red ones<br />
Let's stop all the fight<br />
<br />
A very merry Christmas<br />
And a happy New Year<br />
Let's hope it's a good one<br />
Without any fear<br />
<br />
And so this is Christmas<br />
And what have we done<br />
Another year over<br />
And a new one just begun<br />
And so Happy Christmas<br />
We hope you have fun<br />
The near and the dear ones<br />
The old and the young.<br />
<br />
A very merry Christmas<br />
And a happy New Year<br />
Let's hope it's a good one<br />
Without any fear<br />
