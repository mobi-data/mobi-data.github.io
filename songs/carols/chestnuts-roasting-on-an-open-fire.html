<h1>Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire</h1>
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire<br />
Jack Frost nipping at your nose<br />
Yuletide carols – <br />
being sung by a choir<br />
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.<br />
<br />
Everybody knows a turkey,<br />
and some mistletoe<br />
Help to make the season bright.<br />
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow<br />
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.<br />
They know that Santa’s on his way<br />
He’s loaded lots of toys<br />
and goodies on his sleigh.<br />
And ev’ry mother’s Child<br />
is gonna spy to see if<br />
Reindeer really know how to fly.<br />
<br />
And so, I’m offering this<br />
Simple phrase to kids<br />
from one to ninety-two<br />
Although it’s been said<br />
many times many ways,<br />
“Merry Christmas to you…”<br />
