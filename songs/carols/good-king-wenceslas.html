<h1>Good King Wenceslas</h1>
Good King Wenceslas looked out,<br />
On the Feast of Stephen,<br />
When the snow lay round about,<br />
Deep and crisp and even;<br />
Brightly shone the moon<br />
that night,<br />
Tho' the frost was cruel,<br />
When a poor man came in sight,<br />
Gath'ring winter fuel.<br />
<br />
"Hither, page, and stand by me,<br />
If thou know'st it, telling,<br />
Yonder peasant, who is he?<br />
Where and what his dwelling?"<br />
"Sire, he lives a good league hence,<br />
Underneath the mountain;<br />
Right against the forest fence,<br />
By Saint Agnes' fountain."<br />
<br />
"Bring me flesh,<br />
and bring me wine,<br />
Bring me pine logs hither:<br />
Thou and I will see him dine,<br />
When we bear them thither."<br />
Page and monarch,<br />
forth they went,<br />
Forth they went together;<br />
Thro' the rude wind's wild lament<br />
And the bitter weather.<br />
<br />
"Sire, the night is darker now,<br />
And the wind blows stronger;<br />
Fails my heart, I know not how,<br />
I can go no longer."<br />
Mark my footsteps, good my page;<br />
Tread thou in them boldly:<br />
Thou shalt find the winter's rage<br />
Freeze thy blood less coldly."<br />
<br />
In his master's steps he trod,<br />
Where the snow lay dinted;<br />
Heat was in the very sod<br />
Which the saint had printed.<br />
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,<br />
Wealth or rank possessing,<br />
Ye who now will bless the poor,<br />
Shall yourselves find blessing.<br />
