# Do You Hear What I Hear?

Said the night wind –
to the little lamb.
2x: Do you see what I see?  << 2x??
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
2x: Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite.

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? 
Ringing thru the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? 
A song, a song 
High above the tree 
With a voice as big as the sea 
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king 
Do you know what I know? 
In your palace warm, mighty king 
Do you know what I know? 
A Child, a Child 
Shivers in the cold 
Let us bring Him silver and gold 
Let us bring Him silver and gold

Said the king to the people ev'rywhere 
Listen to what I say! 
Pray for peace, people ev'rywhere 
Listen to what I say! 
The Child, the Child 
Sleeping in the night 
He will bring us goodness and light 
He will bring us goodness and light
