<h1>Sleigh Ride</h1>
Just hear those<br />
sleigh bells jingle-ing<br />
Ring ting tingle-ing too<br />
Come on, it's lovely weather<br />
For a sleigh ride together with you<br />
Outside the snow is falling<br />
And friends are calling "You Hoo"<br />
Come on, it's lovely weather<br />
For a sleigh ride together with you<br />
<br />
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap,<br />
giddy-yap let's go<br />
Let's look at the snow<br />
We're riding in<br />
a wonderland of snow<br />
Giddy-yap giddy-yap<br />
giddy-yap it's grand<br />
Just holding your hand<br />
We're gliding along with the song<br />
Of a wintry fairy land<br />
<br />
Our cheeks are nice and rosy<br />
And comfy cozy are we<br />
We're snuggled up together<br />
like two<br />
Birds of a feather would be<br />
Let's take the road before us<br />
And sing a chorus or two<br />
Come on, it's lovely weather<br />
For a sleigh ride together with you.<br />
