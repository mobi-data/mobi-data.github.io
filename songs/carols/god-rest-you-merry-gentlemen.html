<h1>God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen</h1>
God rest you merry, gentlemen,<br />
Let nothing you dismay,<br />
Remember Christ our Savior<br />
Was born on Christmas day,<br />
To save us all from Satan's pow'r<br />
When we were gone astray.<br />
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br />
Comfort and joy,<br />
O tidings of comfort and joy.<br />
<br />
In Bethlehem, in Israel, this blessed babe was born<br />
And laid within a manger upon the blessed morn.<br />
The which his mother Mary did nothing take in scorn.<br />
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br />
Comfort and joy,<br />
O tidings of comfort and joy.<br />
<br />
From God our heavenly Father<br />
A blessed angel came.<br />
And unto certain shepherds<br />
Brought tidings of the same,<br />
How that in Bethlehem was born<br />
The Son of God by name.<br />
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br />
Comfort and joy,<br />
O tidings of comfort and joy.<br />
