D                          A      D
Said the night wind to the little lamb
D               G D
Do you see what I see
D                 A      D
Way up in the sky little lamb
D               G  D
Do you see what I see
  Bm      F#    A              Bm  
A star, a star, dancing in the night 
       G       A        F# 
With a tail as big as a kite 
       G       A        D
With a tail as big as a kite


Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? 
Ringing thru the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? 
A song, a song 
High above the tree 
With a voice as big as the sea 
With a voice as big as the sea 


Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king 
Do you know what I know? 
In your palace warm, mighty king 
Do you know what I know? 
A Child, a Child 
Shivers in the cold 
Let us bring Him silver and gold 
Let us bring Him silver and gold 


Said the king to the people ev'rywhere 
Listen to what I say! 
Pray for peace, people ev'rywhere 
Listen to what I say! 
The Child, the Child 
Sleeping in the night 
He will bring us goodness and light 
He will bring us goodness and light
