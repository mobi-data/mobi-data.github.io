<h1>We Three Kings of Orient are</h1>

We three kings of Orient are;<br />
Bearing gifts we treasure afar,<br />
field and fountain, moor and mountain,<br />
following yonder star.<br />
O star of wonder, star of night,<br />
Star with royal beauty bright<br />
Westward leading, still proceeding<br />
Guide us to thy perfect light.<br />
<br />
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain<br />
Gold I bring to crown him again<br />
King forever, ceasing never<br />
Over us all to reign.<br />
O star of wonder, star of night,<br />
Star with royal beauty bright<br />
Westward leading, still proceeding<br />
Guide us to thy perfect light.<br />
<br />
Frankincense to offer have I,<br />
Incense owns a Deity nigh;<br />
Prayer and praising,<br />
all men raising,<br />
Worship him God most high.<br />
O star of wonder, star of night,<br />
Star with royal beauty bright<br />
Westward leading, still proceeding<br />
Guide us to thy perfect light.<br />
<br />
Myrrh is mine; it's bitter perfume<br />
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;<br />
Sorrowing, sighing,<br />
bleeding, dying,<br />
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.<br />
O star of wonder, star of night,<br />
Star with royal beauty bright<br />
Westward leading, still proceeding<br />
Guide us to thy perfect light.<br />
