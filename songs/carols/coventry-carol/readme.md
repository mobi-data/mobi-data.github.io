Lullay, thou little tiny Child,   
By-bye lully, lullay.   
Lullay, thou little tiny Child,   
By-bye lully, lullay.   
  
O sisters too, how may we do   
For to preserve this day,   
This poor youngling for whom we  
sing // By-bye lully, lullay.   
  
Herod the King, in his raging,  
Charged he hath this day;   
His men of might, in his own sight,  
All children young, to slay.   
  
Then woe is me poor child, for thee  
And ever mourn and say;   
For Thy parting nor say nor sing,  
By-bye lully, lullay.
