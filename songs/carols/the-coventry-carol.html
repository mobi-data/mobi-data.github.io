<h1>The Coventry Carol</h1>
Lullay, thou little tiny Child, <br />
By-bye lully, lullay. <br />
Lullay, thou little tiny Child, <br />
By-bye lully, lullay. <br />
<br />
O sisters too, how may we do <br />
For to preserve this day, <br />
This poor youngling for whom we<br />
sing // By-bye lully, lullay. <br />
<br />
Herod the King, in his raging,<br />
Charged he hath this day; <br />
His men of might, in his own sight,<br />
All children young, to slay. <br />
<br />
Then woe is me poor child, for thee<br />
And ever mourn and say; <br />
For Thy parting nor say nor sing,<br />
By-bye lully, lullay. <br />
