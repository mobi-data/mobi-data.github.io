## Good King Wenceslas

```
G         Em D/F# G          D
Good King Wences -las looked out
C      D7       G
On the Feast of Stephen,
Em       D/F#     G      D
When the snow lay round about
C        D7        G
Deep and crisp and even
G                       B7   Em
Brightly shone the moon that night
C        D7        G
Tho' the frost was cruel,
G           B7  Em      D
When a poor man came in sight
G/B       D      Em C G
Gath‘ring winter fu-u-el.



 G       Em    D/F# G        D
"Hither, page, and  stand by me
C       D7          G
If thou know'st it, telling,
Em     D/F#     G      D
Yonder peasant, who is he?
C         D7       G
Where and what his dwelling?"
 G                     B7     Em
"Sire, he lives a good league hence
C    D7        G
Underneath the mountain;
G             B7  Em     D
Right against the forest fence
G/B      D      Em  C  G
By Saint Agnes' fou-ountain."



G         Em    D/F# G        D
"Bring me flesh and  bring me wine
C        D7        G
Bring me pine logs hither:
Em       D/F#    G       D
Thou and I shall see him dine
C       D7        G
When we bear them thither. "
G                       B7   Em
Page and monarch, forth they went
C          D7     G
Forth they went together;
G                B7     Em     D
Through the rude wind's wild lament
G/B     D      Em  C G
And the bitter wea-eather.”



G          Em    D/F# G      D
"Sire, the night is   darker now
C       D7         G
And the wind blows stronger;
Em       D/F#     G        D
Fails my heart, I know not how
C     D7    G
I can go no longer."
 G                       B7 Em
"Mark my footsteps, good my page.
C          D7      G
Tread thou in them boldly
G               B7  Em       D
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
G/B        D          Em C  G
Freeze thy blood less co-oldly."



G      Em D/F#  G        D
In his master's steps he trod
C         D7       G
Where the snow lay dinted;
Em       D/F#   G    D
Heat was in the very sod
C         D7        G
Which the saint had printed.
G                         B7 Em
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
C         D7      G
Wealth or rank possessing,
G          B7   Em        D
Ye who now will bless the poor
G/B       D           Em  C G
Shall yourselves find ble-essing.
