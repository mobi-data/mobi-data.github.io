# Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols –
being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey,
and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa’s on his way
He’s loaded lots of toys
and goodies on his sleigh.
And ev’ry mother’s child
is gonna spy to see if
Reindeer really know how to fly.

And so, I’m offering this
Simple phrase to kids
from one to ninety-two
Although it’s been said
many times many ways,
"Merry Christmas to you…"
