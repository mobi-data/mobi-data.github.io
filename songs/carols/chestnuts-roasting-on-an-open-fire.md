[Verse]
```
C          Dm6           C/E    Fm6
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
C    C6    C7              F   E7
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Am       Fm6/G#       C/G       F#m7 B7
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
    Emaj7         Fm7 Bb7       EbM7   D7sus4
And folks dressed up   like Eskimos

         C       Dm7             C/E      Fm6
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
C    C6  C7             F      E7 G#
Help to make the season bright
Am   Fm6/G#          C/G      B
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
     Em      Am      Dm7   G   C
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

               Gm7            C7
They know that Santa's on his way
            Gm7              C7
He’s loaded lots of toys and goodies
        FM7
On his sleigh
          Fm7           Bb11       EbM7
And every mother’s child is gonna spy
          Am7             D7          Dm7   G13b9
To see if Reindeer really know how to fly

    C      Dm6           C/E           Fm6
And so I’m offering this simple phrase
     C  C6   C7            F    E/G#
To kids from one to ninety two
   Am             Fm/G#     C/G         F#m7b5   B7
Although its been said many times, many ways
      Em7    A7 Dm7 G7 CM7
Merry Christmas to     you
