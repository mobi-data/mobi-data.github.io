<h1>Santa Claus is Coming to Town</h1>
Oh! You better watch out,<br />
you better not shout,<br />
you better not cry,<br />
I'm telling you why:<br />
Santa Claus is coming to town!<br />
<br />
He sees you when you're sleeping,<br />
He knows when you're awake.<br />
He knows when you've been bad or good,<br />
So be good for goodness sake!<br />
<br />
He's making a list,<br />
Checking it twice,<br />
Gonna find out who's<br />
naughty or nice.<br />
Santa Claus is coming to town!<br />
