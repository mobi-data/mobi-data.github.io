<h1>Do You Hear What I Hear?</h1>
Said the night wind –<br />
to the little lamb.<br />
2x: Do you see what I see?<br />
Way up in the sky, little lamb,<br />
2x: Do you see what I see?<br />
A star, a star, dancing in the night<br />
With a tail as big as a kite<br />
With a tail as big as a kite.<br />
<br />
Said the little lamb – <br />
to the shepherd boy,<br />
2x: Do you hear what I hear?<br />
Ringing through the sky, – shepherd boy,<br />
2x: Do you hear what I hear?<br />
A song, a song,<br />
high above the trees<br />
With a voice as big as the sea<br />
With a voice as big as the sea.<br />
<br />
Said the shepherd boy – <br />
to the mighty king,<br />
2x: Do you know what I know?<br />
In your palace warm, mighty king,<br />
2x: Do you know what I know?<br />
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold<br />
Let us bring Him silver and gold<br />
Let us bring Him silver and gold.<br />
<br />
Said the king – <br />
to the people everywhere,<br />
2x: Listen to what I say!<br />
Pray for peace, people everywhere!<br />
2x: Listen to what I say!<br />
The Child, the Child, –<br />
sleeping in the night<br />
He will bring us – <br />
goodness and light.<br />
He will bring us – <br />
goodness and light<br />
