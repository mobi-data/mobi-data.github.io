<h1>Rudolf, the Red-Nosed Reindeer</h1>
You know Dasher and Dancer<br />
and Prancer and Vixen,<br />
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen, <br />
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?<br />
<br />
Rudolf, the red-nosed reindeer<br />
had a very shiny nose.<br />
And if you ever saw him,<br />
you would even say it glows.<br />
<br />
All of the other reindeer<br />
used to laugh and call him names.<br />
They never let poor Rudolf<br />
play in any reindeer games.<br />
<br />
Then one foggy Christmas eve<br />
Santa came to say:<br />
"Rudolf with your nose so bright,<br />
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"<br />
<br />
Then how the reindeer loved him<br />
as they shouted out with glee:<br />
"Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer,<br />
you'll go down in history!"<br />
