<p>The collection currently has lyrics for 27 carols. Please feel free to request more lyrics. 
It might be nice to have the lyrics for about fifty carols.</p>
<p>These lyrics were first collected and printed out in paper song books for the Christmas meet-up of <b>The Laughing and Singing Club</b> 
held at the Verplancke residence in Marin County, California in 1997.</p>
<p>Some of the carols are still under copyright protection and thus the legality of displaying the lyrics may be an issue. 
A New York Times article, '<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/business/media/10lyrics.html" target="_blank">Lyrics Sites at Center of Fight Over Royalties</a>' 
has a number interesting comments on the topic.
I have started exploring the process of obtaining permission to display the lyrics. 
It is not easy because the publishers are geared towards dealing with very large players with lots of time and money - which is not what I am.
There will be updates as I find out more about the process.</p>
