<h1>The First Noël</h1>
The first Noël the angel did say<br />
Was to certain poor shepherds –<br />
in fields as they lay;<br />
In fields as they lay, –<br />
keeping their sheep,<br />
on a cold winter's night –<br />
that was so deep.<br />
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël,<br />
Born is the King of Israel.<br />
<br />
They looked up and saw a star<br />
Shining in the east<br />
beyond them far,<br />
And to the earth it gave great light,<br />
And so it continued<br />
both day and night.<br />
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël,<br />
Born is the King of Israel.<br />
<br />
This star drew nigh<br />
to the northwest,<br />
O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,<br />
And there it did both stop and stay<br />
Right over the place<br />
where Jesus lay.<br />
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël,<br />
Born is the King of Israel.<br />
