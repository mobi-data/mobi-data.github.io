<h1>This Land is Your Land</h1>
This land is your land This land is my land<br>
From California to the New York island; <br>
From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters <br>
This land was made for you and Me.<br>
<br>
As I was walking that ribbon of highway, <br>
I saw above me that endless skyway: <br>
I saw below me that golden valley: <br>
This land was made for you and me.<br>
<br>
I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps <br>
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; <br>
And all around me a voice was sounding: <br>
This land was made for you and me.<br>
<br>
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, <br>
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, <br>
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting: <br>
This land was made for you and me.<br>
<br>
As I went walking I saw a sign there <br>
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing." <br>
But on the other side it didn't say nothing, <br>
That side was made for you and me.<br>
<br>
In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people, <br>
By the relief office I seen my people; <br>
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking <br>
Is this land made for you and me?<br>
<br>
Nobody living can ever stop me, <br>
As I go walking that freedom highway; <br>
Nobody living can ever make me turn back <br>
This land was made for you and me.<br>
