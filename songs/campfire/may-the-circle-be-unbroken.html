<h1>May the Circle Be Unbroken</h1>
I was standing by my window, <br>
On one cold and cloudy day <br>
When I saw that hearse come rolling <br>
For to carry my mother away <br>
<br>
Will the circle be unbroken <br>
By and by, Lord, by and by <br>
There's a better home a-waiting <br>
In the sky, Lord, in the sky <br>
<br>
I said to that undertaker <br>
Undertaker please drive slow <br>
For this lady you are carrying <br>
Lord, I hate to see here go <br>
<br>
Will the circle be unbroken <br>
By and by, Lord, by and by <br>
There's a better home a-waiting <br>
In the sky, Lord, in the sky <br>
<br>
Oh, I followed close behind her <br>
Tried to hold up and be brave <br>
But I could not hide my sorrow <br>
When they laid her in the grave <br>
<br>
Will the circle be unbroken <br>
By and by, Lord, by and by <br>
There's a better home a-waiting <br>
In the sky, Lord, in the sky <br>
<br>
I went back home, my home was lonesome <br>
Missed my mother, she was gone <br>
All of my brothers, sisters crying <br>
What a home so sad and lone <br>
<br>
Will the circle be unbroken <br>
By and by, Lord, by and by <br>
There's a better home a-waiting <br>
In the sky, Lord, in the sky <br>
<br>
We sang the songs of childhood <br>
Hymns of faith that made us strong <br>
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us <br>
Hear the angels sing along <br>
<br>
Will the circle be unbroken <br>
By and by, Lord, by and by <br>
There's a better home a-waiting <br>
In the sky, Lord, in the sky <br>
<br>
Will the circle be unbroken <br>
By and by, Lord, by and by <br>
There's a better home a-waiting <br>
In the sky, Lord, in the sky<br>
