<h1>Bicycle Built for Two</h1>
There is a flower within my heart,<br>
Daisy, Daisy,<br>
Planted one day by a glancing dart,<br>
Planted by Daisy Bell.<br>
Whether she loves me or loves me not<br>
Sometimes it's hard to tell,<br>
And yet I am longing to share the lot<br>
Of beautiful Daisy Bell.<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do,<br>
I'm half crazy all for the love of you.<br>
It won't be a stylish marriage,<br>
I can't afford a carriage,<br>
But you'd look sweet upon the seat<br>
Of a bicycle built for two.<br>
We will go tandem as man and wife,<br>
Daisy, Daisy,<br>
Ped'ling away down the road of life,<br>
I and my Daisy Bell.<br>
When the road's dark, we can both despise<br>
P'licemen and lamps as well.<br>
There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes<br>
Of beautiful Daisy Bell.<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do...<br>
I will stand by you in weal or woe<br>
Daisy, Daisy,<br>
You'll be the bell which I'll ring, you know,<br>
Sweet little Daisy Bell.<br>
You'll take the lead on each trip we take.<br>
Then if I don't do well<br>
I will permit you to use the brake,<br>
beautiful Daisy Bell<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do...<br>
