<h1>Battle Hymn of the Republic</h1>
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;<br>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;<br>
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:<br>
His truth is marching on.<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
His truth is marching on.<br>
<br>
I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps,<br>
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;<br>
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:<br>
His day is marching on.<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
His day is marching on.<br>
<br>
I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel:<br>
"As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;<br>
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,<br>
Since God is marching on.<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Since God is marching on.<br>
<br>
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;<br>
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat:<br>
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!<br>
Our God is marching on.<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Our God is marching on.<br>
<br>
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,<br>
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me.<br>
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,<br>
While God is marching on.<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
While God is marching on.<br>
<br>
He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,<br>
He is Wisdom to the mighty, He is Succour to the brave,<br>
So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of Time His slave,<br>
Our God is marching on.<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah.<br>
Our God is marching on.<br>
