<h1>Mr. Tambourine Man</h1>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.<br>
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand<br>
Vanished from my hand<br>
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping<br>
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet<br>
I have no one to meet<br>
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.<br>
<br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to <br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.<br>
<br>
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship<br>
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip<br>
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels<br>
To be wanderin'<br>
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade<br>
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way<br>
I promise to go under it.<br>
<br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to <br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.<br>
<br>
Though you might hear laughin', spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun<br>
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run<br>
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'<br>
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme<br>
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind<br>
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're<br>
Seein' that he's chasing.<br>
<br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to <br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.<br>
<br>
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind<br>
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves<br>
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach<br>
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow<br>
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free<br>
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands<br>
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves<br>
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to <br>
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me<br>
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.<br>
