<h1>You are My Sunshine</h1>
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<br>
You make me happy when skies are grey<br>
You never know, dear, how much I love you<br>
Please don't take my sunshine away<br>
<br>
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping<br>
I dreamt I held you in my arms<br>
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken<br>
So I hung my head, and I cried<br>
<br>
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<br>
You make me happy when skies are grey<br>
You never know, dear, how much I love you<br>
Please don't take my sunshine away<br>
<br>
I'll always love you and make you happy<br>
If you will only say the same<br>
But if you leave me to love another,<br>
You'll regret it all one day<br>
<br>
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<br>
You make me happy when skies are grey<br>
You never know, dear, how much I love you<br>
Please don't take my sunshine away<br>
<br>
Please don't take my sunshine away
