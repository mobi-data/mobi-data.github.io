<h1>Gallo del Cielo</h1>
Carlos Saragosa left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full<br>
He had no money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in Gold<br>
He headed for el Sueco, stole a rooster named Gallo Del Cielo<br>
Then he crossed the Rio Grande with that roosted nestled deep within his arm<br>
<br>
Galllo del Cielo was a warrior born in heaven so the legends say<br>
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye rollin crazy in his head<br>
He'd fought a hundred fights and the legends say that one night near El Sueco <br>
He fought Cielo seven times, seven times he left brave roosters dead<br>
<br>
Hola my Teresa I'm thinkin of you now in San Antonio<br>
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your good luck of your picture framed in gold<br>
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo<br>
Then I'll return to buy the land Pancho Villa stole from father long ago<br>
<br>
Outside of San Diego in the Onion fields of Paco Monte Verde<br>
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk<br>
Adn they laughed when Saragosa pulled the one-eyed Del Cielo from beneath his shirt<br>
But they cried when Saragosa waked away with a thousand dollar bill<br>
<br>
Hola my Teresa I'm thinkin of you now in Santa Barbara<br>
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your good luck of your picture framed in gold<br>
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo<br>
Then I'll return to buy the land Pancho Villa stole from father long ago<br>
<br>
Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light spills shadows on the fighting sand<br>
A wicked black named Zorro faces Del Cielo in the sand<br>
And Carlos Saragosa fears the tiny crack that runs across his roosters beak<br>
And he fears that he has lost the 50,000 dollars riding on the fight<br>
<br>
Hola my Teresa I'm thinkin of you now in Santa Clara<br>
The money's on the table, I'm holding now your good luck framed in gold<br>
Everything we dream of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo<br>
Then I'll return to buy the land Pancho Villa stole from father long ago<br>
<br>
The signal it was given and the roosters rose together far above the sand<br>
Gallo Del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast<br>
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought each other time and time again<br>
And the legends all agreed that Gallo Del Cielo fought the best<br>
<br>
But then the screams of Saragosa filled the night outside the town of Santa Clara<br>
As the beak of Del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand<br>
And they say that Saragosa screamed a curse upon the bones of Pancho Villa<br>
As Zorro rose up one more time and drove Del Cielo in the sand<br>
<br>
Hola my Teresa I'm thinkin of you now in San Francisco<br>
I have no money in my pocket I no longer have your good luck framed in gold<br>
I buried it last evening with the bones of my beloved Del Cielo<br>
I will not return to buy the land that Villa stole long ago<br>
<br>
Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved Casas Grandes?<br>
Does the scar upon my brother's face turn red when he hears mention of my name?<br>
And do the people of El Sueco still curse the theft of Gallo Del Cielo?<br>
Tell my family not to worry, I will not return to cause them shame.<br>
