<h1>Blowin in the Wind</h1>
How many roads most a man walk down<br>
Before you call him a man ?<br>
How many seas must a white dove sail<br>
Before she sleeps in the sand ?<br>
Yes, how many times must the cannon balls fly<br>
Before they're forever banned ?<br>
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind.<br>
<br>
Yes, how many years can a mountain exist<br>
Before it's washed to the sea ?<br>
Yes, how many years can some people exist<br>
Before they're allowed to be free ?<br>
Yes, how many times can a man turn his head<br>
Pretending he just doesn't see ?<br>
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind.<br>
<br>
Yes, how many times must a man look up<br>
Before he can see the sky ?<br>
Yes, how many ears must one man have<br>
Before he can hear people cry ?<br>
Yes, how many deaths will it take till he knows<br>
That too many people have died ?<br>
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind.<br>
