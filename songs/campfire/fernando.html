<h1>Fernando</h1>
Can you hear the drums Fernando?<br>
I remember long ago another starry night like this<br>
In the firelight Fernando<br>
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar<br>
I could hear the distant drums<br>
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar<br>
<br>
They were closer now Fernando<br>
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally<br>
I was so afraid Fernando<br>
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die<br>
And I'm not ashamed to say<br>
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry<br>
<br>
There was something in the air that night<br>
The stars were bright, Fernando<br>
They were shining there for you and me<br>
For liberty, Fernando<br>
Though we never thought that we could lose<br>
There's no regret<br>
If I had to do the same again<br>
I would, my friend, Fernando<br>
<br>
Now we're old and grey Fernando<br>
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand<br>
Can you hear the drums Fernando?<br>
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?<br>
I can see it in your eyes<br>
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land<br>
<br>
There was something in the air that night<br>
The stars were bright, Fernando<br>
They were shining there for you and me<br>
For liberty, Fernando<br>
Though we never thought that we could lose<br>
There's no regret<br>
If I had to do the same again<br>
I would, my friend, Fernando<br>
<br>
There was something in the air that night<br>
The stars were bright, Fernando<br>
They were shining there for you and me<br>
For liberty, Fernando<br>
Though we never thought that we could lose<br>
There's no regret<br>
If I had to do the same again<br>
I would, my friend, Fernando<br>
Yes, if I had to do the same again<br>
I would, my friend, Fernando...<br>
