<h1>America the Beautiful</h1>
O beautiful for spacious skies, <br>
For amber waves of grain, <br>
For purple mountain majesties <br>
Above the fruited plain! <br>
America! America! <br>
God shed his grace on thee <br>
And crown thy good with brotherhood <br>
From sea to shining sea! <br>
<br>
O beautiful for pilgrim feet <br>
Whose stern impassioned stress<br>
A thoroughfare of freedom beat <br>
Across the wilderness! <br>
America! America! <br>
God mend thine every flaw, <br>
Confirm thy soul in self-control, <br>
Thy liberty in law! <br>
<br>
O beautiful for heroes proved <br>
In liberating strife. <br>
Who more than self their country loved<br>
And mercy more than life! <br>
America! America! <br>
May God thy gold refine <br>
Till all success be nobleness <br>
And every gain divine! <br>
<br>
O beautiful for patriot dream <br>
That sees beyond the years <br>
Thine alabaster cities gleam <br>
Undimmed by human tears! <br>
America! America! <br>
God shed his grace on thee <br>
And crown thy good with brotherhood <br>
From sea to shining sea! <br>
<br>
O beautiful for halcyon skies, <br>
For amber waves of grain, <br>
For purple mountain majesties <br>
Above the enameled plain! <br>
America! America! <br>
God shed his grace on thee <br>
Till souls wax fair as earth and air <br>
And music-hearted sea! <br>
<br>
O beautiful for pilgrims feet, <br>
Whose stem impassioned stress <br>
A thoroughfare for freedom beat <br>
Across the wilderness! <br>
America! America! <br>
God shed his grace on thee <br>
Till paths be wrought through <br>
wilds of thought <br>
By pilgrim foot and knee! <br>
<br>
O beautiful for glory-tale <br>
Of liberating strife <br>
When once and twice, <br>
for man's avail <br>
Men lavished precious life! <br>
America! America! <br>
God shed his grace on thee <br>
Till selfish gain no longer stain <br>
The banner of the free! <br>
<br>
O beautiful for patriot dream <br>
That sees beyond the years <br>
Thine alabaster cities gleam <br>
Undimmed by human tears! <br>
America! America! <br>
God shed his grace on thee <br>
Till nobler men keep once again <br>
Thy whiter jubilee!<br>
