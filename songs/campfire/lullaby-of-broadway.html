<h1>Lullaby of Broadway</h1>
Peggy:<br>
[Spoken]<br>
I'm sorry show business isn't for me. I'm goin' back to Allentown!<br>
<br>
Julian:<br>
What was the word you've just said, Allentown?<br>
I'm offering you a chance to star in biggest musical<br>
Broadway's seen in twenty years and you say: "Allentown?"<br>
<br>
[Singing]<br>
Come on along and listen to <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The hip hooray and bally hoo, <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The rumble of the subway train,<br>
The rattle of the taxis.<br>
The daffy-dills who entertain<br>
At Angelo's and Maxie's.<br>
<br>
When a Broadway baby says "Good night,"<br>
It's early in the morning.<br>
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn:<br>
Good night, baby,<br>
Good night, milkman's on his way.<br>
Sleep tight, baby,<br>
Sleep tight, let's call it a day,<br>
Listen to the lullaby of old Broadway.<br>
<br>
Ensemble:<br>
Come on along and listen to <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The hidee hi and boopa doo, <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The band begins to go to town,<br>
And ev'ryone goes crazy.<br>
You rock-a-bye your baby 'round <br>
'Til ev'rything gets hazy.<br>
<br>
Hush-a-bye, "I'll buy you this and that,"<br>
You hear a daddy sayin'.<br>
And baby goes home to her flat<br>
To sleep all day:<br>
Good night, baby,<br>
Good night, milkman's on his way.<br>
Sleep tight, baby,<br>
Sleep tight, let's call it a day!<br>
Listen to the lullaby of old Broadway.<br>
<br>
Come on along and listen to <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The hip hooray and bally hoo, <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The rumble of the subway train,<br>
The rattle of the taxis.<br>
The daffy-dills who entertain<br>
Until the dawn:<br>
Good night, baby,<br>
Good night, milkman's on his way.<br>
<br>
Peggy:<br>
[Spoken]<br>
I'll do it!<br>
<br>
Ensemble:<br>
[Cheers!]<br>
<br>
[Singing]<br>
Come on along-<br>
Come on along and listen to <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The hidee hi and boopa doo, <br>
The lullaby of Broadway.<br>
The band begins to go to town,<br>
And ev'ryone goes crazy.<br>
You rock-a-bye your baby 'round <br>
And sleep all day!<br>
Listen to the lullaby of <br>
Old Broadway!<br>
