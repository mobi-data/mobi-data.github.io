<h1>California Dreaming</h1>
All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey <br>
I've been for a walk on a winters dayI'd be save and warm if I was in LA california dreaming on such a winters day <br>
<br>
Stepped into a church I passed along the way well, I got down on my knees andI pretended to pray you know the preacher likes the cold he knows I'm gonna stay <br>
California dreaming on such a winters day <br>
<br>
Instrumental <br>
<br>
All the leaves a brown and the sky is grey I've been for a walk on a winters day <br>
If I didn't tell her I could leave today <br>
California dreaming on such a winters day<br>
