<h1>No Woman No Cry</h1>
No, woman, no cry;<br>
No, woman, no cry;<br>
No, woman, no cry;<br>
No, woman, no cry.<br>
<br>
'Cause - 'cause - 'cause I remember when a we used to sit<br>
In a government yard in Trenchtown,<br>
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites - yeah! -<br>
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah!<br>
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we have lost<br>
Along the way, yeah!<br>
In this great future, you can't forget your past;<br>
So dry your tears, I seh. Yeah!<br>
<br>
No, woman, no cry;<br>
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!<br>
A little darlin', don't shed no tears:<br>
No, woman, no cry. Eh!<br>
<br>
Said - said - said I remember when we used to sit<br>
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah!<br>
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,<br>
I seh, logwood burnin' through the nights, yeah!<br>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, say,<br>
Of which I'll share with you, yeah!<br>
My feet is my only carriage<br>
And so I've got to push on through.<br>
Oh, while I'm gone,<br>
Everything's gonna be all right!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right-a!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah!<br>
Everything's gonna be all right!<br>
<br>
So no, woman, no cry;<br>
No, woman, no cry.<br>
I seh, O little - O little darlin', don't shed no tears;<br>
No, woman, no cry, eh.<br>
<br>
No, woman - no, woman - no, woman, no cry;<br>
No, woman, no cry.<br>
One more time I got to say:<br>
O little - little darlin', please don't shed no tears;<br>
No, woman, no cry.<br>
