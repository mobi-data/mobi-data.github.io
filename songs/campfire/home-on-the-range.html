<h1>Home on the Range</h1>
Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam,<br>
Where the deer and the antelope play,<br>
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,<br>
And the skies are not cloudy all day.<br>
<br>
Chorus Home, home on the range,<br>
Where the deer and the antelope play,<br>
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,<br>
And the skies are not cloudy all day.<br>
<br>
Where the air is so pure, and the zephyrs so free,<br>
The breezes so balmy and light,<br>
That I would not exchange my home on the range,<br>
For all of the cities so bright.<br>
<br>
The Red man was pressed from this part of the west,<br>
He's likely no more to return,<br>
To the banks of the Red River where seldom if ever<br>
Their flickering campfires burn.<br>
<br>
How often at night when the heavens are bright,<br>
With the light from the glittering stars,<br>
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed,<br>
If their glory exceeds that of ours.<br>
<br>
Oh, I love these wild flowers in this dear land of ours,<br>
The curlew I love to hear cry,<br>
And I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks,<br>
That graze on the mountain slopes high.<br>
<br>
Oh give me a land where the bright diamond sand,<br>
Flows leisurely down in the stream;<br>
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along,<br>
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.<br>
<br>
Then I would not exchange my home on the range,<br>
Where the deer and the antelope play;<br>
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,<br>
And the skies are not cloudy all day.<br>
