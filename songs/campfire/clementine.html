<h1>Clementine</h1>
In a cavern, In a canyon, <br>
Excavating for a mine, <br>
Dwelt a miner forty-niner, <br>
And his daughter Clementine.<br>
<br>
Chorus: <br>
Oh my darling, Oh my darling, <br>
Oh my darling Clementine, <br>
You are lost and gone forever, <br>
Dreadful sorry Clementine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
Light she was and like a fairy, <br>
And her shoes were number nine; <br>
Herring boxes, without topses, <br>
Sandals were for Clementine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
Drove she ducklings to the water, <br>
Every morning just at nine; <br>
Hit her foot against a splinter, <br>
Fell into the foaming brine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
Ruby lips above the water, <br>
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine; <br>
But Alas! I was no swimmer, <br>
So I lost my Clementine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
When the miner forty-niner,<br>
Soon began to peak and pine,<br>
Thought he oughter "jine" his daughter,<br>
Now he's with his clementine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
In a corner of the churchyard,<br>
Where the myrtle boughs entwine,<br>
Grow the roses in their poses,<br>
Fertilized by Clementine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
In my dreams she still doth haunt me,<br>
Robed in garments soaked in brine.<br>
Though in life I used to hug her,<br>
Now she's dead, I'll draw the line.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
How I missed her, how I missed her<br>
How I missed my Clementine.<br>
So I kissed her little sister,<br>
And forgot my Clementine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
Now you Boy Scouts, there's a moral<br>
To this little tale of mine.<br>
Artificial respiration,<br>
Would have saved my Clementine.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
