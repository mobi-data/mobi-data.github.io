<h1>Yellow Bird</h1>
Yellow bird,<br>
Up high in banana tree<br>
Yellow bird<br>
You sit all alone like me<br>
<br>
Did your lady friend<br>
Leave the nest again<br>
That is very sad<br>
Make me feel so bad<br>
<br>
You can fly away<br>
In the sky away<br>
You more lucky than me<br>
<br>
I also have a pretty man<br>
He not with me today<br>
They all the same<br>
The pretty men<br>
Make them the nest<br>
Then they fly away<br>
<br>
Yellow bird<br>
Up high in banana tree<br>
Yellow bird<br>
You sit all alone like me<br>
<br>
Better fly away<br>
In the sky away<br>
Picker coming soon<br>
Pick from night to noon<br>
Black on yellow too<br>
Like banana too<br>
They might pick you someday<br>
<br>
Wish that I was a yellow bird<br>
I'd fly away with you<br>
But I am not a yellow bird<br>
So here I sit, nothing else to do<br>
<br>
Yellow bird<br>
Up high in banana tree<br>
Yellow bird<br>
You sit all alone like me<br>
<br>
Did your lady friend<br>
Leave the nest again<br>
That is very sad<br>
Make me feel so bad<br>
<br>
You can fly away<br>
In the sky away<br>
You're more lucky than me<br>
<br>
Yellow bird<br>
Just you and me<br>
Yellow bird<br>
And a little one make t(h)ree<br>
