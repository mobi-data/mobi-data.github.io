<h1>Oh What a Beautiful Morning</h1>

There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,<br>
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,<br>
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye,<br>
An' it looks like its climbin' clear up to the sky.<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Oh what a beautiful morning,<br>
Oh what a beautiful day,<br>
I've got a wonderful feeling,<br>
Everything's going my way.<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
All the cattle are standing like statues,<br>
All the cattel are standing like statues,<br>
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by.<br>
But a little brown mav'rick is winking her eye.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
All the sounds of the earth are like music,<br>
All the sounds of the earth are like music,<br>
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree,<br>
And an ol' Weepin' Willer is laughin' at me.<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
