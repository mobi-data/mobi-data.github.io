<h1>Any Dream Will Do</h1>
Joseph <br>
<br>
I closed my eyes, drew back the curtain<br>
To see for certain what I thought I knew<br>
Far far away, someone was weeping<br>
But the world was sleeping<br>
Any dream will do<br>
<br>
Joseph & Children <br>
<br>
I wore my coat, with golden lining<br>
Bright colours shining, wonderful and new<br>
And in the east, the dawn was breaking<br>
And the world was waking<br>
Any dream will do<br>
<br>
Joseph <br>
<br>
A crash of drums, a flash of light<br>
My golden coat flew out of sight<br>
The colours faded into darkness<br>
I was left alone<br>
<br>
Joseph & Children <br>
<br>
May I return to the beginning<br>
The light is dimming, and the dream is too<br>
The world and I, we are still waiting<br>
Still hesitating<br>
Any dream will do <br>
Joseph <br>
<br>
A crash of drums, a flash of light<br>
My golden coat flew out of sight<br>
The colours faded into darkness<br>
I was left alone<br>
<br>
Joseph & Children <br>
<br>
May I return to the beginning<br>
The light is dimming, and the dream is too<br>
The world and I, we are still waiting<br>
Still hesitating<br>
Any dream will do<br>
