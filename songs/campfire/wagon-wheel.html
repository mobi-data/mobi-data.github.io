<h1>Wagon Wheel</h1>
Heading down south to the land of the pines<br>
I'm thumbing my way into North Carolina<br>
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights<br>
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours<br>
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers<br>
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight<br>
<br>
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel<br>
Hey momma rock me<br>
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
Hey momma rock me<br>
<br>
Running from the cold up in New England<br>
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band<br>
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now<br>
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down<br>
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town<br>
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more<br>
<br>
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel<br>
Hey momma rock me<br>
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
Hey momma rock me<br>
<br>
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke<br>
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke<br>
But he's a-heading west from the Cumberland gap<br>
To Johnson City, Tennessee<br>
I gotta get a move on before the sun<br>
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one<br>
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free<br>
<br>
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel<br>
Hey momma rock me<br>
Oh, rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
Hey, hey momma rock me<br>
<br>
Oh, so rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel (I wanna feel)<br>
Hey, hey momma rock me (momma rock me, momma rock me)<br>
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
(I wanna rock like a south bound train)<br>
Hey momma rock me<br>
Rock me<br>
