<h1>Oh Susanna</h1>
I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee, <br>
I'm going to Louisiana, my true love for to see. <br>
It rained all night the day I left, the weather it was dry <br>
The sun so hot I froze to death, Susanna, don't you cry.<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Oh! Susanna, Oh don't you cry for me, <br>
For I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee.<br>
<br>
I had a dream the other night, when everything was still; <br>
I thought I saw Susanna dear, a coming down the hill. <br>
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth, a tear was in her eye, <br>
Says I, I'm coming from the south, Susanna, don't you cry.<br>
<br>
I soon will be in New Orleans, and then I'll look around, <br>
And when I find Susanna, I'll fall upon the ground. <br>
But if I do not find her, then I will surely die, <br>
And when I'm dead and buried, Oh, Susanna, don't you cry.<br>
