<h1>If I had a Hammer</h1>
If I had a hammer,<br>
I'd hammer in the morning,<br>
I'd hammer in the evening,<br>
All over this land,<br>
I'd hammer out danger,<br>
I'd hammer out a warning,<br>
I'd hammer out love between,<br>
My brothers and my sisters,<br>
All over this land.<br>
<br>
If I had a bell,<br>
I'd ring it in the morning,<br>
I'd ring it in the evening,<br>
All over this land,<br>
I'd ring out danger,<br>
I'd ring out a warning,<br>
I'd ring out love between,<br>
My brothers and my sisters,<br>
All over this land.<br>
<br>
If I had a song<br>
I'd sing it in the morning<br>
I'd sing it in the evening<br>
all over this land<br>
I'd sing out danger<br>
I'd sing out warning<br>
I'd sing out love between<br>
my brothers and my sisters<br>
all over this land<br>
<br>
Well, I've got a hammer<br>
and I've got a bell<br>
and I've got a song to sing<br>
all over this land<br>
It's the hammer of justice<br>
It's the bell of freedom<br>
It's a song about love between my<br>
brothers and my sisters<br>
all over this land<br>
<br>
It's the hammer of justice<br>
It's the bell of freedom<br>
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters<br>
All over this la-a-and<br>
