<h1>Proud Mary</h1>
Left a good job in the city <br>
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day <br>
And I never lost one minute of sleepin' <br>
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been <br>
<br>
Big wheel keep on turnin' <br>
Proud Mary keep on burnin' <br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river <br>
<br>
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis <br>
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans <br>
But I never saw the good side of the city <br>
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen <br>
<br>
Big wheel keep on turnin' <br>
Proud Mary keep on burnin' <br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river <br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river <br>
<br>
If you come down to the river <br>
Bet you gonna find some people who live <br>
You don't have to worry 'cause you have [if you got] no money <br>
People on the river are happy to give <br>
<br>
Big wheel keep on turnin' <br>
Proud Mary keep on burnin' <br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river <br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river <br>
<br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river <br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river <br>
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river<br>
