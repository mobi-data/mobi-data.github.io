<h1>Me and Bobby McGee</h1>
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train<br>
And I's feeling nearly as faded as my jeans.<br>
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained,<br>
It rode us all the way to New Orleans.<br>
<br>
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna,<br>
I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.<br>
Windshield wipers slapping time, I was holding Bobby's hand in mine,<br>
We sang every song that driver knew.<br>
<br>
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,<br>
Nothing don't mean nothing honey if it ain't free, now now.<br>
And feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,<br>
You know feeling good was good enough for me,<br>
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.<br>
<br>
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun,<br>
Hey, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul.<br>
Through all kinds of weather, through everything that we done,<br>
Hey Bobby baby kept me from the cold.<br>
<br>
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away,<br>
He's looking for that home and I hope he finds it,<br>
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday<br>
To be holding Bobby's body next to mine.<br>
<br>
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,<br>
Nothing, that's all that Bobby left me, yeah,<br>
But feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,<br>
Hey, feeling good was good enough for me, hmm hmm,<br>
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.<br>
<br>
La la la, la la la la, la la la, la la la la<br>
La la la la la Bobby McGee.<br>
La la la la la, la la la la la<br>
La la la la la, Bobby McGee, la.<br>
<br>
La La la, la la la la la la,<br>
La La la la la la la la la, hey now Bobby now Bobby McGee yeah.<br>
Na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na na na<br>
Hey now Bobby now, Bobby McGee, yeah.<br>
<br>
Lord, I'm calling my lover, calling my man,<br>
I said I'm calling my lover just the best I can,<br>
C'mon, where is Bobby now, where is Bobby McGee, yeah,<br>
Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lord<br>
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGee, Lord!<br>
<br>
Yeah! Whew!<br>

Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGee.<br>
