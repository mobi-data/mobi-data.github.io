<h1>Take Me Out to the Ball Game</h1>
Take me out to the ball game<br>
Take me out with the crowd<br>
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks<br>
I don't care if I never get back<br>
Let me root, root, root<br>
For the home team<br>
If they don't win it's a shame<br>
Aahh.<br>
For it's one, <br>
Two,<br>
Three strikes you're out<br>
At the old ball game<br>
<br>
All I need is just one chance<br>
I could hit a home run<br>
There isn't anyone else like me<br>
Maybe I'll go down in history<br>
And it's root, root, root<br>
For the home team<br>
Here comes fortune and fame<br>
'Cause I know<br>
That<br>
I'll be the star<br>
At the old<br>
Ball <br>
Game<br>
