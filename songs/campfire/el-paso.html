<h1>El Paso</h1>
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso<br>
I fell in love with a Mexican girl.<br>
Night-time would find me in Rosa's cantina;<br>
Music would play and Felina would whirl.<br>
<br>
Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina,<br>
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.<br>
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden;<br>
I was in love but in vain, I could tell.<br>
<br>
One night a wild young cowboy came in,<br>
Wild as the West Texas wind.<br>
Dashing and daring,<br>
A drink he was sharing<br>
With wicked Felina,<br>
The girl that I loved.<br>
<br>
So in anger I<br>
<br>
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden.<br>
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.<br>
My challenge was answered in less than a heart-beat;<br>
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.<br>
<br>
Just for a moment I stood there in silence,<br>
Shocked by the FOUL EVIL deed I had done.<br>
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there;<br>
I had but one chance and that was to run.<br>
<br>
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran,<br>
Out where the horses were tied.<br>
I caught a good one.<br>
It looked like it could run.<br>
Up on its back<br>
And away I did ride,<br>
<br>
Just as fast as I<br>
<br>
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso<br>
Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico.<br>
<br>
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless.<br>
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left.<br>
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden<br>
My love is stronger than my fear of death.<br>
<br>
I saddled up and away I did go,<br>
Riding alone in the dark.<br>
Maybe tomorrow<br>
A bullet may find me.<br>
Tonight nothing's worse than this<br>
Pain in my heart.<br>
<br>
And at last here I<br>
<br>
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso;<br>
I can see Rosa's cantina below.<br>
My love is strong and it pushes me onward.<br>
Down off the hill to Felina I go.<br>
<br>
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys;<br>
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.<br>
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me.<br>
I have to make it to Rosa's back door.<br>
<br>
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel<br>
A deep burning pain in my side.<br>
Though I am trying<br>
To stay in the saddle,<br>
I'm getting weary,<br>
Unable to ride.<br>
<br>
But my love for<br>
<br>
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen,<br>
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest.<br>
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle.<br>
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.<br>
<br>
From out of nowhere Felina has found me,<br>
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.<br>
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,<br>
One little kiss and Felina, good-bye. <br>
