<h1>Oh Freedom</h1>
Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me<br>
And before I'd be a slave I'll be buried in a my grave<br>
And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
<br>
No more mourning, no more mourning, no more mourning over me<br>
And before I'd be a slave I'll be buried in a my grave<br>
And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
<br>
No more crying, no more crying, no more crying over me<br>
And before I'd be a slave I'll be buried in a my grave<br>
And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
<br>
Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me<br>
And before I'd be a slave I'll be buried in a my grave<br>
And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
<br>
There'll be singin', there'll be singin', there'll be singin' over me<br>
And before I'd be a slave I'll be buried in a my grave<br>
And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
<br>
Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me<br>
And before I'd be a slave I'll be buried in a my grave<br>
And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
