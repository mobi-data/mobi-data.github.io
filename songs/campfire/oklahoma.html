<h1>Oklahoma</h1>
There's never been a better time to start in life- <br>
It ain't too early and it aint too late!<br>
Starting as a farmer with a brand new wife-<br>
Soon be livin' in a brand new state!<br>
Brand new state - gonna treat you great!<br>
Gonna bring you barley, carrots and pertaters, <br>
Pasture for the cattle, spinich and termaters,<br>
Flowers on the prarie where the June bugs zoom,<br>
Plen'y of air and plen'y of room,<br>
Plen'y of room to swing a rope!<br>
Plen'y of heart and plen'y of hope.<br>
<br>
OOOOk-lahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain,<br>
And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet, When the wind comes right behind the rainQ<br>
OOOOk-lahoma, Ev'ry night my honey lamb and I, Sit alone and talk and watch a hawk makin' lazy circles in the sky.<br>
<br>
We know we belong to the land (yo-ho)<br>
And the land we belong to is grand!<br>
And when we say <br>
Yeeow! Aye-yip-aye-yo-ee-ay!<br>
We're only sayin'<br>
You're doin' fine, Oklahoma!<br>
Oklahoma O.K.!<br>
<br>
Ooook-lahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain<br>
And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet<br>
When the wind comes right behind the rain.<br>
Oklahoma, Ev'ry night my honey lamb and I<br>
Sit alone and talk and watch a hawk<br>
Makin' lazy circles in the sky.<br>
<br>
We know we belong to the land<br>
And the land we belong to is grand!<br>
And when we say <br>
Yeeow! Ayipioeeay!<br>
We're only sayin'<br>
You're doin' fine, Oklahoma!<br>
Oklahoma O.K.<br>

We know we belong to the land<br>
And the land we belong to is grand!<br>
And when we say <br>
Yeeow! Aye-yip-aye-yo-ee-ay!<br>
We're only sayin'<br>
You're doin' fine, Oklahoma!<br>
Oklahoma <br>
