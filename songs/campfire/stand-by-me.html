<h1>Stand By Me</h1>
When the night has come<br>
And the land is dark<br>
And the moon is the only light we'll see<br>
No I won't be afraid<br>
Oh, I won't be afraid<br>
Just as long as you stand, stand by me<br>
<br>
So darling, darling<br>
Stand by me, oh stand by me<br>
Oh stand, stand by me<br>
Stand by me<br>
<br>
If the sky that we look upon<br>
Should tumble and fall<br>
All the mountains should crumble to the sea<br>
I won't cry, I won't cry<br>
No, I won't shed a tear<br>
Just as long as you stand, stand by me<br>
<br>
And darling, darling<br>
Stand by me, oh stand by me<br>
Oh stand now, stand by me<br>
Stand by me<br>
<br>
So darling, darling<br>
Stand by me, oh stand by me<br>
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me<br>
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me<br>
Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand<br>
Stand by me<br>
Stand by me<br>
