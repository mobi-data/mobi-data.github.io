<h1>I've Been Working on the Railroad</h1>

I've been working on the railroad<br>
All the live long day<br>
I've been working on the railroad<br>
Just to pass the time away<br>
Don't you hear the whistle blowin'<br>
Rise up so early in the morn<br>
Can't you hear the captain shouting<br>
Dinah blow your horn<br>
<br>
Dinah won't you blow<br>
Dinah won't you blow<br>
Dinah won't you blow your ho-o-o-orn<br>
Dinah won't you blow<br>
Dinah won't you blow<br>
Dinah won't you blow your horn<br>
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah<br>
Someone's in the kitchen I know oh-oh-oh<br>
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah<br>
Strumming on the old banjo<br>
Fee fi fiddle e i o<br>
Fee fi fiddle e i o-o-o-o<br>
Fee fi fiddle e i o<br>
Strumming on the old banjo<br>
Don't you hear the whistle blowin'<br>
Rise up so early in the morn<br>
Can't you hear the captain shouting<br>
Dinah blow your horn<br>
<br>
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah<br>
Someone's in the kitchen I know oh-oh-oh<br>
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah<br>
Strumming on the old banjo<br>
Fee fi fiddle e i o<br>
Fee fi fiddle e i o-o-o-o<br>
Fee fi fiddle e i o<br>
Strumming on the old banjo<br>
Strumming on the old banjo<br>
Strumming on the old banjo-o-o<br>
