<h1>Country Roads</h1>
Almost heaven, West Virginia <br>
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River <br>
Life is old there, older than the trees <br>
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze <br>
<br>
Chorus: <br>
Country roads, take me home <br>
To the place I belong <br>
West Virginia, Mountain Mama <br>
Take me home, country roads <br>
<br>
All my memories, gathered 'round her <br>
Miners' Lady, stranger to blue water <br>
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky <br>
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye <br>
<br>
Chorus <br>
<br>
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me <br>
The radio reminds me of my home far away <br>
And drivin' down the road I get the feeling <br>
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday <br>
<br>
Chorus x 2 (modulates)<br>
