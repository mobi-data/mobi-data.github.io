<h1>American Pie</h1>
A long, long time ago<br>
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile<br>
And I knew if I had my chance<br>
That I could make those people dance<br>
And maybe they'd be happy for a while<br>
<br>
But February made me shiver<br>
With every paper I'd deliver<br>
Bad news on the doorstep<br>
I couldn't take one more step<br>
<br>
I can't remember if I cried<br>
When I read about his widowed bride<br>
But something touched me deep inside<br>
The day the music died<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry<br>
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die<br>
This'll be the day that I die"<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Did you write the book of love<br>
And do you have faith in God above<br>
If the Bible tells you so?<br>
Now do you believe in rock and roll<br>
Can music save your mortal soul<br>
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?<br>
<br>
Well, I know that you're in love with him<br>
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym<br>
You both kicked off your shoes<br>
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues<br>
<br>
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck<br>
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck<br>
But I knew I was out of luck<br>
The day the music died<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die<br>
This'll be the day that I die"<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Now for ten years we've been on our own<br>
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone<br>
But that's not how it used to be<br>
When the jester sang for the king and queen<br>
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean<br>
And a voice that came from you and me<br>
<br>
Oh, and while the king was looking down<br>
The jester stole his thorny crown<br>
The courtroom was adjourned<br>
No verdict was returned<br>
<br>
And while Lenin read a book on Marx<br>
A quartet practiced in the park<br>
And we sang dirges in the dark<br>
The day the music died<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry <br>
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die<br>
This'll be the day that I die"<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Helter skelter in a summer swelter<br>
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter<br>
Eight miles high and falling fast<br>
It landed foul on the grass<br>
The players tried for a forward pass<br>
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast<br>
<br>
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume<br>
While the sergeants played a marching tune<br>
We all got up to dance<br>
Oh, but we never got the chance<br>
<br>
'Cause the players tried to take the field<br>
The marching band refused to yield<br>
Do you recall what was revealed<br>
The day the music died?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die<br>
This'll be the day that I die"<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Oh, and there we were all in one place<br>
A generation lost in space<br>
With no time left to start again<br>
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick<br>
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick<br>
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend<br>
<br>
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage<br>
My hands were clenched in fists of rage<br>
No angel born in Hell<br>
Could break that Satan's spell<br>
<br>
And as the flames climbed high into the night<br>
To light the sacrificial rite<br>
I saw Satan laughing with delight<br>
The day the music died<br>
<br>
He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die<br>
This'll be the day that I die"<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
I met a girl who sang the blues<br>
And I asked her for some happy news<br>
But she just smiled and turned away<br>
I went down to the sacred store<br>
Where I'd heard the music years before<br>
But the man there said the music wouldn't play<br>
<br>
And in the streets, the children screamed<br>
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed<br>
But not a word was spoken<br>
The church bells all were broken<br>
<br>
And the three men I admire most<br>
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost<br>
They caught the last train for the coast<br>
The day the music died<br>
<br>
And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry<br>
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die<br>
This'll be the day that I die"<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie<br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye<br>
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die"<br>
