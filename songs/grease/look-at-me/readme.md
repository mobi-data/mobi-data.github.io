Look at me I'm Sandra Dee  
Lousy with virginity  
Won't go to bed till I'm legally wed  
I can't I'm Sandra Dee  
  
Watch it! Hey, I'm Doris Day  
I was not brought up that way  
Won't come across even Rock Hudson lost  
His heart to Doris Day  
  
I don't drink I swear  
I don't rat my hair  
I get ill from one cigarette  
Keep your filthy paws off my silky drawers  
Would you pull that crap with Annette?  
  
As for you Troy Donahue  
I know what you wanna do  
You've got your crust I'm no object of lust  
I'm just plain Sandra Dee  
  
Elvis, Elvis, let me be  
Keep that pelvis far from me  
Just keep your cool now your starting to drool  
  
Hey, Fongul, I'm Sandra Dee
