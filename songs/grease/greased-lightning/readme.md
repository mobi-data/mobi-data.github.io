Why this car is automatic  
It's systematic  
It's hydromatic  
Why it's grease lightning (Grease lightning)  
  
We'll get some overhead lifters and some four barrel quads  
oh yeah  
(Keep talking whoa keep talking)  
A fuel injection cutoff and chrome plated rods oh yeah  
(I'll get the money I'll kill to get the money)  
With a four speed on the floor they'll be waiting at the door  
You know that ain't no shit we'll be getting lots of tit  
In Grease Lightning  
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go  
  
Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile  
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)  
Go grease lightning you're coasting through the heat lap trial  
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for grease lightning  
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go  
  
Purple french tail lights and thirty inch fins  
oh yeah  
A Palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins  
oh yeah  
With new pistons, plugs, and shocks I can get off my rocks  
You know that I ain't bragging she's a real pussy wagon  
Grease lightning  
  
Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile  
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)  
Go grease lighting you're coasting through the heat lap trial  
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for grease lightning  
Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile  
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)  
Go grease lighting you're coasting through the hit lap trial  
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for grease lightning  
Lightning, lightning, lightning   
Lightning, lightning, lightning  
Lightning
