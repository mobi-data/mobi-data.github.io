===
  
I got chills they're multiplying  
And I'm losing control  
Cause the power you're supplying  
It's Electrifying!  
  
You better shape up cause I need a man  
And my heart is set on you  
You better shape up, you better understand  
To my heart I must be true  
  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
The one that I need oh yes indeed  
  
If you're filled with affection  
You're too shy to convey  
Meditate in my direction  
Feel your way  
  
I better shape up, cause you need a man (I need a man)  
Who can keep me satisfied  
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove (you better prove)  
That my faith is justified  
Are you sure? Yes I'm sure down deep inside  
  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
The one that I need oh yes indeed  
  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
The one that I need oh yes indeed  
  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
The one that I need oh yes indeed  
  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want) ho ho ho honey  
The one that I need oh yes indeed
