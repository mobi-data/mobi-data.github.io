<h1>There Are Worse Things I Could Do</h1>
There are worse things I could do<br />
Than go with a boy or two<br />
Even though the neighbourhood<br />
Thinks I'm trashy and no good<br />
I suppose it could be true<br />
But there are worse things I could do<br />
<br />
I could flirt with all the guys<br />
Smile at them and bat my eyes<br />
Press against them when we dance <br />
Make them think they stand a chance<br />
Then refuse to see it through<br />
That's a thing I'd never do<br />
<br />
I could stay home every night<br />
Wait around for mister right<br />
Take cold showers everyday<br />
And throw my life away<br />
On a dream that won't come true<br />
<br />
I could hurt someone like me<br />
Out of spite or jealousy<br />
I don't steal and I don't lie<br />
But I can feel and I can cry<br />
A fact I'll bet you never knew<br />
But to cry in front of you<br />
That's the worst thing I could do <br />
