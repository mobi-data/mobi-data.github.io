<h1>Blue Moon</h1>
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone<br />
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own<br />
<br />
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for<br />
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for<br />
<br />
And then suddenly appeared before me, 
 &nbsp; the only one my arms could ever hold<br />
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'<br />
But when I looked, that moon had turned to gold - oh oh oh<br />
<br />
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone<br />
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own<br />
Without a love of my own<br />
<br />
Repeat.<br />
