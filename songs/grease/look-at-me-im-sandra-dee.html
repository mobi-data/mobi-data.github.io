<h1>Look at Me I'm Sandra Dee</h1>
Look at me I'm Sandra Dee<br />
Lousy with virginity<br />
Won't go to bed till I'm legally wed<br />
I can't I'm Sandra Dee<br />
<br />
Watch it! Hey, I'm Doris Day<br />
I was not brought up that way<br />
Won't come across even Rock Hudson lost<br />
His heart to Doris Day<br />
<br />
I don't drink I swear<br />
I don't rat my hair<br />
I get ill from one cigarette<br />
Keep your filthy paws off my silky drawers<br />
Would you pull that crap with Annette?<br />
<br />
As for you Troy Donahue<br />
I know what you wanna do<br />
You've got your crust I'm no object of lust<br />
I'm just plain Sandra Dee<br />
<br />
Elvis, Elvis, let me be<br />
Keep that pelvis far from me<br />
Just keep your cool now your starting to drool<br />
<br />
Hey, Fongul, I'm Sandra Dee <br />
