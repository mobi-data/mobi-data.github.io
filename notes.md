### 2017-12-21 ~ Theo

* Menu swiping = left and right - beginning to work
* Christmas Carols
	* first five songs beginning to look and feel as they should



### 2017-12-19 ~ Theo

* Yet again completely rebuilt

The current demo is a 'wireframe'. It has no styling and the content is not much more than a 'lorem ipsum'.

There should, however, be enough material for you to judge whether  

* Motivated but non-technical people could add and edit text
* People of all walks could navigate the app quickly and easily enough to find useful stuff in a timely fashion

A swipe ability is planned but not yet incorporated into the code.

The donut pages include maps - open source maps as supplied GitHub. This is just an experiment. Future revision will just have 'map it' links...

***

Today's update was quite major. The overall structure of the app is much simplified.
